- excerpt by aeon -
this game was made by a lot of people, but i'm the one who has the build tools, so i get to make the readme!
although i wasn't brought on board until the last 36 hours, i did my best. the original game was in haxe, but due to [bad luck] combined with [aeon doesn't know anything other than gamemaker] it is now in gamemaker.
it loads .sm files directly, so i guess it's moddable? have fun.
thanks to everybody on the team for letting me help out with a cool game after i realized my inevitable fate in my own entry.
